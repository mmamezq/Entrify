1. Data Collection and Inspection:
Gather your text data, which can come from various sources like text files, databases, web scraping, or APIs.
Inspect the data to understand its structure, quality, and characteristics. This step is crucial for identifying any issues that may need specific preprocessing.

2. Text Cleaning:
Remove any irrelevant information such as HTML tags, special characters, or non-textual content.
Convert the text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Handle common text issues like misspellings, abbreviations, or acronyms.

3. Tokenization:
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. Deep learning models typically operate on the word or subword level.
You can use libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or tokenizers from Hugging Face's Transformers for tokenization.

4. Stopword Removal:
Remove common stopwords (e.g., "and," "the," "in") that carry little semantic meaning. This can reduce noise in the data.
The list of stopwords depends on the language and can be obtained from NLP libraries.

5. Stemming or Lemmatization:
Reduce words to their root forms to standardize variations of words (e.g., "running" -> "run").
Stemming is a more aggressive approach that may result in non-words, while lemmatization provides valid dictionary words.

6. Text Vectorization:
Transform the tokenized text into numerical vectors that deep learning models can work with.
Common techniques include Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.
Consider using pre-trained word embeddings for better results if you have a large dataset.

7. Padding and Sequence Length:
Ensure that all input sequences have the same length by padding or truncating them as necessary.
This step is crucial for batch processing and is typically done to match the maximum sequence length in the dataset.

8. Splitting Data:
Divide your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate your model's performance effectively.
Label Encoding:

Convert class labels into numerical values if they are not already encoded. This is essential for classification tasks.

9. Data Loading:
Create data loaders or generators to efficiently feed your data into the deep learning model during training.
